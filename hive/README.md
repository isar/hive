Hive is a lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart. Inspired by [Bitcask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcask).

### [Documentation & Samples](https://docs.hivedb.dev/) üìñ

If you need queries, multi-isolate support or links between objects check out [Isar Database](https://github.com/isar/isar).

## Features

- üöÄ Cross platform: mobile, desktop, browser
- ‚ö° Great performance (see [benchmark](#benchmark))
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Simple, powerful, & intuitive API
- üîí Strong encryption built in
- üéà **NO** native dependencies
- üîã Batteries included

## Getting Started

Check out the [Quick Start](https://docs.hivedb.dev) documentation to get started.

## Usage

You can use Hive just like a map. It is not necessary to await `Futures`.

```dart
var box = Hive.box('myBox');

box.put('name', 'David');

var name = box.get('name');

print('Name: $name');
```

## BoxCollections

`BoxCollections` are a set of boxes which can be similarly used as normal boxes, except of that
they dramatically improve speed on web. They support opening and closing all boxes of a collection
at once and more efficiently store data in indexed DB on web.

Aside, they also expose Transactions which can be used to speed up tremendous numbers of database
transactions on web.

On `dart:io` platforms, there is no performance gain by BoxCollections or Transactions. Only
BoxCollections might be useful for some box hierarchy and development experience.

```dart
// Create a box collection
  final collection = await BoxCollection.open(
    'MyFirstFluffyBox', // Name of your database
    {'cats', 'dogs'}, // Names of your boxes
    path: './', // Path where to store your boxes (Only used in Flutter / Dart IO)
    key: HiveCipher(), // Key to encrypt your boxes (Only used in Flutter / Dart IO)
  );

  // Open your boxes. Optional: Give it a type.
  final catsBox = collection.openBox<Map>('cats');

  // Put something in
  await catsBox.put('fluffy', {'name': 'Fluffy', 'age': 4});
  await catsBox.put('loki', {'name': 'Loki', 'age': 2});

  // Get values of type (immutable) Map?
  final loki = await catsBox.get('loki');
  print('Loki is ${loki?['age']} years old.');

  // Returns a List of values
  final cats = await catsBox.getAll(['loki', 'fluffy']);
  print(cats);

  // Returns a List<String> of all keys
  final allCatKeys = await catsBox.getAllKeys();
  print(allCatKeys);

  // Returns a Map<String, Map> with all keys and entries
  final catMap = await catsBox.getAllValues();
  print(catMap);

  // delete one or more entries
  await catsBox.delete('loki');
  await catsBox.deleteAll(['loki', 'fluffy']);

  // ...or clear the whole box at once
  await catsBox.clear();

  // Speed up write actions with transactions
  await collection.transaction(
    () async {
      await catsBox.put('fluffy', {'name': 'Fluffy', 'age': 4});
      await catsBox.put('loki', {'name': 'Loki', 'age': 2});
      // ...
    },
    boxNames: ['cats'], // By default all boxes become blocked.
    readOnly: false,
  );
```


## Store objects

Hive not only supports primitives, lists and maps but also any Dart object you like. You need to generate a type adapter before you can store objects.

```dart
@HiveType(typeId: 0)
class Person extends HiveObject {

  @HiveField(0)
  String name;

  @HiveField(1)
  int age;
}
```

Extending `HiveObject` is optional but it provides handy methods like `save()` and `delete()`.

```dart
var box = await Hive.openBox('myBox');

var person = Person()
  ..name = 'Dave'
  ..age = 22;
box.add(person);

print(box.getAt(0)); // Dave - 22

person.age = 30;
person.save();

print(box.getAt(0)) // Dave - 30
```

## Hive ‚ù§Ô∏è Flutter

Hive was written with Flutter in mind. It is a perfect fit if you need a lightweight datastore for your app. After adding the required dependencies and initializing Hive, you can use Hive in your project:

```dart
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
import 'package:hive_flutter/hive_flutter.dart';

class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ValueListenableBuilder(
      valueListenable: Hive.box('settings').listenable(),
      builder: (context, box, widget) {
        return Switch(
          value: box.get('darkMode'),
          onChanged: (val) {
            box.put('darkMode', val);
          }
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Boxes are cached and therefore fast enough to be used directly in the `build()` method of Flutter widgets.

### Native AES crypto implementation

When using Flutter, Hive supports native encryption using [package:cryptography](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography)
and [package:cryptography_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography_flutter).

Native AES implementations tremendously speed up operations on encrypted Boxes.

Please follow these steps:

1. add dependency to pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dependencies:
  cryptography_flutter: ^2.0.2
```

2. enable native implementations

```dart
import 'package:cryptography_flutter/cryptography_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Enable Flutter cryptography
  FlutterCryptography.enable();

  // ....
}
```

## Benchmark

|                                         1000 read iterations                                         |                                    1000 write iterations                                    |

| SharedPreferences is on par with Hive when it comes to read performance. SQLite performs much worse. | Hive greatly outperforms SQLite and SharedPreferences when it comes to writing or deleting. |

The benchmark was performed on a Oneplus 6T with Android Q. You can [run the benchmark yourself](https://github.com/hivedb/hive_benchmark).

\*Take this benchmark with a grain of salt. It is very hard to compare databases objectively since they were made for different purposes.
