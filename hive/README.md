Hive is a lightweight and blazing fast key-value store written in pure Dart. Inspired by [Bitcask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcask).

*Hive is not ready for production yet. I'm working hard on a stable version.*

## Features

### Cross-platform ⚡
- Runs on desktop, mobile & in browser
- Very good performance (see [benchmark](#benchmark))


### Easy to use ❤️
- Keys are ints or Strings and values are arbitrary objects
- The basic operations are `put(key, value)`, `get(key)`, `delete(key)`
- Strong encryption built in

### Lightweight 🎈
- Small runtime
- Small disk space consumption
- **NO** native dependencies

| SharedPreferences is on par with Hive when it comes to read performance. SQLite performs much worse. | Hive greatly outperforms SQLite and SharedPreferences when it comes to writing or deleting. |

This benchmark was performed on a Oneplus 6T with Android Q. All entries are read and written one after another. You can [run the benchmark yourself](https://github.com/leisim/hive_benchmark).

## Getting Started

### Initialize

Hive needs a directory where it can store its data. Call `Hive.init()` the first time you use Hive.

```dart
Hive.init('path/to/hive');
```

In the browser you don't have to call `init()`.

### Open a Box

All of your data is stored in boxes.

```dart
var box = await Hive.openBox('testBox');
```

Just provide an `encryptionKey` to encrypt a box:

```dart
var key = Hive.generateSecureKey();
var box = await Hive.openBox('secureBox', encryptionKey: key);
```

### Read & Write

Hive supports all primitive types, `List`, `Map`, `DateTime` and `Uint8List`. Any object can be can stored using [TypeAdapters](https://leisim.github.io/hive/#/generate_adapter)

```dart
var dog = Dog(name: 'Nero', age: 4);

box.put('myDog', dog);

Dog myDog = box.get('myDog');
```

## Hive ❤️ Flutter

Hive was written with Flutter in mind. It is a perfect fit if you need a lightweight datastore for your app. Here is a sample how that may look like:

```dart
class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return WatchBoxBuilder(
      box: Hive.box('settings');
      builder: (context, box) {
        return Switch(
          value: box.get('darkMode'),
          onChanged: (val) {
            box.put('darkMode', val);
          }
        )
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Boxes are cached and therefore fast enough to be used directly in the `build()` method of Flutter widgets.

## Todo

The work on Hive has just started. If you want to contribute, it would be amazing if you helped me with one of these:

- [x] Good test coverage
- [ ] Many examples, especially for Flutter
- [ ] Finalize API
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Write binary format spec
- [ ] Even more tests
- [x] Benchmarks and comparison
