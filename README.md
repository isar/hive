Hive is a lightweight and blazing-fast key-value database made for Flutter and Dart.

## Features

- üöÄ Cross platform: mobile, desktop, browser
- ‚ö° Great performance
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Simple, powerful, & intuitive API
- üîí Strong encryption built in
- üéà Resource friendly
- üçø Multi-isolate support
- üîã Batteries included

## Quick Start

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add dependencies

Add `hive` and `path_provider` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  hive: ^4.0.0
  path_provider: ^2.1.0
```

`path_provider` is used to find a valid location to store the database.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set the default directory

This is where Hive should store its data.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.defaultDirectory = dir.path;

  // ...
}
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start using Hive

You're ready to go! Have fun using Hive üêù

```dart
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';

final myBox = Hive.box();
myBox.put('name', 'David');

final name = myBox.get('name');
print('Name: $name');
```

## üìí Documentation

All data stored in Hive is organized in boxes. A box can be compared to a table in SQL, but it does not have a structure and can contain anything.

For a small app, a single box might be enough. For more advanced problems, boxes are a great way to organize your data. Boxes can also be encrypted to store sensitive data.

### üóÉÔ∏è Opening Boxes

Opening a box is simple:

```dart
final box = Hive.box(name: 'myBox');
```

When you call `Hive.box(name: 'myBox')` for the first time with a given name, Hive will create a new box. If you call it again with the same name, Hive will return the already existing box. You can also use `Hive.box()` without a name. In this case, Hive will return the default box.

There are optional parameters you can pass to `Hive.box()`:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`          | The name of the box                                                                              |
| `directory`     | The path where the box should be stored. If not specified, Hive will use the `defaultDirectory`. |
| `encryptionKey` | If provided, the box will be encrypted and can only be opened if the same key is provided again. |
| `maxSizeMiB`    | The maximum size of the box in MiB. Try to use a small value.                                    |

### üåÇ Closing Boxes

It is not recommended to close boxes if they are still used at a later time. However if the user logs out of your app, you might want to close your boxes:

To close a single box just call `box.close()`. To close all boxes use `Hive.closeAllBoxes()`. Sometimes you may want to close a box and delete all of its data. You can do this by calling `box.deleteFromDisk()` or `Hive.deleteAllBoxesFromDisk()`.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Inserting data

At its core, a box is just a key-value store. String keys are mapped to arbitrary primitive values. You can think of a box as a persisted `Map<String, dynamic>`.

```dart
final box = Hive.box();
box.put('theme', 'dark');
box.put('isLoggedIn', true);
box.put('brightness', 22.7);
```

If a specific key already exists, the value will be overwritten. You can also store lists and maps of primitives:

```dart
box.put('list', [1, 2, 3]);
box.put('map', {'name': 'Dave', 'age': 22});
```

There is an alternative syntax for storing values that is more similar to a `Map`:

```dart
box['theme'] = 'dark';
box['isLoggedIn'] = true;
box['brightness'] = 22.7;
```

To store multiple values at once, you can use `box.putAll()`:

```dart
box.putAll({'theme': 'dark', 'brightness': 22.7});
```

### ü§ì Reading data

To read data from a box, you can use `box.get()` and `box.getAll()`. If a key does not exist, `box.get()` will return `null`. You can also specify a default value:

```dart
final themeBox = Hive.box(name: 'theme');
final brightness = themeBox.get('brightness');
final fontSize = themeBox.get('fontSize', defaultValue: 14.0);
```

Similar to `box.put()`, you can also use the `[]` operator to read values:

```dart
final brightness = themeBox['brightness'];
final fontSize = themeBox['fontSize'] ?? 14.0;
```

### üßπ Deleting data

To delete a single value, you can use `box.delete()`:

```dart
box.delete('theme');
```

### ü™Ñ Using Boxes like Lists

Previously we treated boxes like maps. However, you can also use them like lists:

```dart
final box = Hive.box();

box.add('value1');
box.add('value2');

print(box.getAt(0)); // value1
print(box.getAt(1)); // value2
```

Just like in lists, index-based operations will throw an error if the index is out of bounds:

```dart
final box = Hive.box();
box.add('value1');
print(box.getAt(1)); // This will throw an error
```

Even if we insert a key-value pair we can still access the values by index.

```dart
final box = Hive.box();

box.add('value1');
box.put('key', 'value2');
box.add('value3');

print(box.getAt(0)); // value1
print(box.getAt(1)); // value2
print(box.getAt(2)); // value3
```

Of course, we can also use the `[]` operator in combination with indexes :

```dart
final box = Hive.box();

box.add('value1');
print(box[0]); // value1

box[0] = 'value2';
box[1] = 'value3'; // This will throw an error
```

### üíÉ Type safety

Boxes have an optional generic type parameter. This allows you to store only values of a specific type in a box:

```dart
final box = Hive.box<String>(name: 'myStringBox');
box.put('key1', 'value1');
box.put('key2', 'value2');
box.put('key3', 777); // This will throw an error
```

### üëæ Non-primitive Objects

Hive not only supports primitives, lists and maps but also any Dart object you like. Your object just needs a `.fromJson()` and `.toJson()` method:

```dart
class Person {
  Person({required this.name, required this.age});

  factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => Person(
    name: json['name'] as String,
    age: json['age'] as int,
  );

  final String name;

  final int age;

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
    'name': name,
    'age': age,
  };
}
```

When initializing Hive you need to register your class:

```dart
Hive.registerAdapter('Person', Person.fromJson);
```

Now you can store `Person` objects in your boxes:

```dart
final box = Hive.box();

var person = Person()
  ..name = 'Dave'
  ..age = 22;
box.put('dave', person);

print(box.get('dave')); // Dave - 22
```

### ü™¢ Transactions

Transactions are an efficient way to update multiple values at once. They are also useful if you want to make sure that a Box is not changed by other code while you are working with it.

```dart
final box = Hive.box();

box.write(() {
  box.put('key1', 'value1');
  box.put('key2', 'value2');
  box.put('key3', 'value3');
});

box.read(() {
  box.get('key1');
});
```

Changes made in a transaction are always atomic. Either all changes are applied or none of them. So if an error occurs during a transaction, the box will not be changed.

```dart
final box = Hive.box();
box.put('counter', 5);

box.write(() {
  box.put('counter', 6);
  throw Exception('Oh no!!!');
});

print(box.get('counter')); // 5
```
