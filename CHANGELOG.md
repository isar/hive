- `LazyBox` and `Box` now have a common parent class: `BoxBase`
- Lazy boxes need to be opened using `Hive.openLazyBox()`

- Support for relationships, `HiveLists` (see docs for details)
- Support for inheritance
- Lazy boxes can now have a type argument `LazyBox<YourModel>`
- Added method to delete boxes without opening them `Hive.deleteBoxFromDisk()`
- Added `path` parameter to open boxes in a custom path
- Improved documentation

### Fixes

- `HiveObjects` have not been initialized correctly in lazy boxes
- Fixed bug where uppercase box name resulted in an uppercase filename
- Fixed compaction bug which caused corrupted boxes
- Fixed bug which did not allow the key `0xFFFFFFFF`
- Fixed bug where not all `BoxEvent`s have been broadcasted

### More

- Changed type of `encryptionKey` from `Uint8List` to `List<int>`

### Important:

Due to a bug in previous Hive versions, boxes whose name contains uppercase characters were stored in a file that also contains upper case characters (e.g. 'myBox' -> 'myBox.hive').

To avoid different behavior on case sensitive file systems, Hive should store files with lower case names. This bug has been resolved in version 1.2.0.

If your box name contains upper case characters, the new version will not find a box stored by an older version. Please rename the hive file manually in that case.  
This also applies to the web version.
